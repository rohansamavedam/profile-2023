                I'm a software engineer currently living in San Francisco. 
                In the next 2-3 years, I'm driven to use/grow my experience, skills, 
                and education in bringing digital products to life. 
                I'm also learning continuously to pivot into financial technology.  
            `,
            `
                With the tech revolution happening everywhere, from agriculture to aviation 
                and from finance to logistics, I'm pleased that I'm a part of this growth. 
                Since it's a revolution, the most essential skill to possess is being agile and nimble. 
                This means learning new skills, getting out of your comfort zone, 
                and being open to new opportunities wherever they may arise.
            `,
            `
                I use this website to write about the things I'm learning, the projects I'm working on, 
                and the readings I keep referring back to. 
                If you find anything interesting about my work, have an opportunity for me, 
                or want to start a conversation, hmu on LinkedIn or write to me. 
            `,
            `
                When I'm not working or learning, you'll find me playing tennis, 
                listening to chill-electronic beats (or) trending music, cooking, 
                and wandering around the town. Feel free to reach out ðŸ˜€.
