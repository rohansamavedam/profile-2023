            `üëã Hi! I‚Äôm Rohan. I‚Äôm a graduating senior at San Jose State University studying Software Engineering. 
            I‚Äôve interned at Amazon during the summer of 2020, where I worked with Identity team to 
            develop a redirect component in their product flow utilizing various AWS services. `,

            `I‚Äôve gained my experience by doing numerous projects and taking up internships. 
            Most recently, I've led a team of 4 people to develop a travel safety mobile 
            application that helps travelers during this covid-19 crisis. `,

            `With our technology developing very rapidly, I believe that this is an excellent 
            industry to be a part of. This motivates me to keep thinking of groundbreaking 
            business ideas and strive to develop efficient solutions to the problems I face.`,

            `When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me playing tennis üéæ, jamming to hip hop üé∂, cooking gourmet 
            food üçõ, and e-boarding full speed through the trails of Guadalupe park. 
            Feel free to reach out, join my discord channel and we can talk about tech or anything else that's fun. üòÄ`
